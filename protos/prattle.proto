// Proxy handles the proxying and routing of chat messages between parties
// including to parties on other prattle servers.
//
// Authentication is done through bearer tokens, which are time-limited and
// minted through calls to Proxy.Token.
//
// IDs are minted through a two part call to 'Proxy.Signup' and 'Proxy.Finalise'
// which mint an ID and an OTP seed (before validating that seed in Finalise)
//
// A user subscribes to a proxy instance via Proxy.Subscribe by authenticating
// with their bearer token. This token is used to retrieve a user's ID

/*

  Signup flow:
  1. Send a request to 'Proxy.Signup' containing a password, returning a seed for OTP and a new ID
  2. Send a request to 'Proxy.Finalise' containing an OTP

  Login flow:
  1. Send a request to 'Proxy.Token' containing an OTP and a password, receiving a token (these are valid for a set period of time before re-negotiation is needed)
  2. This request should block for an amount of time in the expectation that this will slow down/ discourage attackers
  3. On many failures, block login for an amount of time
